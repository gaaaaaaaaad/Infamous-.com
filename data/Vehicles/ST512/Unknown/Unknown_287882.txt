*Color Templates I Use*

All of these will be Chameleon texture except the ones that specify that they are Chrome, Metal, Matte, etc. However, you can experiment with other textures to find what you like.

Some paints look like crap on certain cars. The longer ago it was that a car was released, the worse Chameleon and similar textures will look. Newer cars like the Gauntlet Interceptor, that are based on cars released a long time ago, are also some of the worst for Chameleon textures. For cars that look like crap with Chameleon, try using Metal, Chrome, and Matte textures instead.

Values may need to be higher or lower on certain vehicles, find what looks good

*Color Changing Paint*

Color Changing Paint is made by using two paints that are connected to each other, in the way that Orange and Green are both connected to Yellow. Make the brightest Yellow your Primary, and the brightest Orange or brightest Green your Secondary. When proportioned correctly, direct sunlight will bleach away the opposing color of your Secondary paint, making it seem to disappear. If this sounds confusing, take a look in the Color Changing Examples folder.

*Quick Reference Guide for Matching Neons, Wheel Color, Tire Smoke, License Plates, and Headlights*

These are what I tend to use when I'm in a hurry. When I want to make really something nice I try to match the colors up better than what is listed here. A general rule of thumb is to move the RGB numbers by about 30 points to change a color noticeably, for example RGB 255, 255, 0 is a Yellow that is tinted slightly Green, this color pairs with Yellow Bird Pearl. If you reduce the green by 30 points, it becomes just Yellow, and pairs with Race Yellow Pearl. Reduce Green by another 30 points and it begins to start tinting Orange, and pairs with Metallic Taxi Yellow Pearl. You can use this 30 point guideline to quickly estimate how much you need to adjust colors, then dial it in from there.

Note that for Wheel color, White usually goes with just about anything (except Gold or maybe Rust and other off-beat stuff). If you want to make something look crisp and fresh, White Wheel color is usually an easy way to start. If you are making a lot of cars in a hurry, pick a set of rims that look good in White, set it to the brightest White, and just let it auto-apply every time you apply your Pearl in LazScript.

*To Create Many Cars Quickly*

If you are in a hurry and don't know what to make, this is what I use as a baseline to churn out a lot of cars very quickly. 

For quick matching neons and tire smoke set them to the RGB of your Primary or Secondary paint and then use the Value slider to find something nice.

First consider making the basics - an all-White, an all-Black, an all-Black Chrome with White Pearl, an all-Black Metal with White Pearl, a Gold Metal 71 with Worn Yellow Pearl, an all-Salmon Pink, dark Gold Metals and Colored Chromes, and any other basic colors you like - Blue, Red, Orange, Yellow and so on. You might also consider making different textured versions of all of these.

Then save each of your basic all-Black, all-White, all-Pink etc cars with every Livery that looks good on them.

After those, you might consider making any of the rest on this list - to do these quickly, first input a set of matching Pearl, Neons, License Plate, and Tire Smoke colors, say for example, Hot Pink, so RGB 255, 0, 255 (or whatever you prefer) in all those categories, then change your Primary and Secondary RGB's to whatever you want, apply the Pearl and all the rest, and save it. Now change the Paint color to another RGB you want to combine with Hot Pink, apply your Pearl and everything else again, and save it, then change to another Paint color and another until you're done with Hot Pink. Then change the color of everything to match something else, let's say Metallic Orange Pearl - set Pearl/Neons/Tire Smoke etc to match that, then pick an RGB to apply it all to, save it, change Paint, save it. By doing it like this you only have to change the Paint color and not everything else every time, which is what really slows you down when you're trying to make many nice cars fast.

Blacklight25 / 30 / 33 / 255 etc is
R 2
G 0
B Usually between 15 - 25 (but can be 30 or 33 or 255, or whatever)

Blacklight is mixed at a ratio of around 7 - 14 parts blue for every 1 part of red. The blue to red mixture should be in between blue and purple, but closer to the blue side than purple (R 25, G 0, B 255 is a highly-visible example of this). For dark blacklight colors, the blue/red base should be so dark that you can just barely tell what color it is. The easiest way to do it is to turn the blue up just enough that you can tell it is definitely a very dark blue color, and either stay there or turn the blue down by one to three points. The goal is for it to look distinct from both vanilla dark blues, dark purples, and black. When it looks something like a twilight sky of colored poison, you've done it right

Then adjust the Value slider of your paint downwards. with a Metal texture and Metallic Taxi Yellow Pearl (most pearl), Matte Yellow Pearl (medium amount), or Worn Taxi Yellow Pearl (least amount of pearl) in order to look correct.

You know those people who wear Mouse masks? Yeah, I dunno either, but if you want to make one of them happy try making them a car in a dark Grey Chameleon texture with a Salmon Pink Pearl. When done right the Grey should be just bright enough to be clearly identifiable as Grey, and the Pink should sort of ripple out of it, see 'Krieger Grey45Black0SalmonPinkPearl' for an example. This won't look good on all cars, though. If they offer you cheese in return it's considered impolite in Mouse society to refuse the cheese
